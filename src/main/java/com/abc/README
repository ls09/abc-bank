I have spent few hours on this assignment. Please let me know if I need to continue working on any specific task.
I have written enough test cases to ensure 100% code coverage.
But a scalable and distributed application needs more time to architect, design, develop, test [and deploy].

TO DO (Work In Progress)
  - Javadoc documentation of key methods
  - Duplicate customers not allowed
  - For one customer - Do not allow multiple accounts of the same type. For example John can not have two Checking accounts
  - Address Performance, Scalability or any other system quality metrics 
  - Test Plan
     - More test cases need to be added to cover all testing scenarios (combinations)
     - Test cases for multi-threading environment
